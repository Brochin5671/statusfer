# Statusfer

## Overview
A public chatting web-app where you can post and see other users' statuses in real-time using a REST API, <span>socket.io</span>, and MongoDB.

## How to Use (Posting is disabled)

**Note**: write access for posting messages has been disabled. This was done to prevent any spam or inappropriate language from appearing on the site as this project was intended to be a demonstration of my full-stack ability. If you would like to see or use this project in full, go to the [How to Run It](#How-to-Run-It) section.

* Go to [Statusfer](https://statusfer.vercel.app)
* Register an account
* Type your first status in the textbox and click Post
* Edit and delete your statuses using the buttons attached to them
* Like or dislike statuses with the feedback buttons
* View a status by clicking the View button
* View a user's profile by clicking on their username
* View your profile or choose to logout by clicking on Profile
* When on profile, click Settings if you want to change your username, email, password, or delete your account
* When logged out, go to Login to access your account again

## How It Works

### Client-side
* Fetch API is used to communicate with the server
* Uses the <span>socket.io</span> client to listen for events and update pages in real-time

### Server-side
* Uses Express.js as the back-end framework for the Node.js environment to deliver resources to the client
* Mongoose API is used to communicate with the MongoDB database
* Bcryptjs hashes passwords so they can be securely stored in the database
* JWTs are used to authenticate users for user requests
* Uses <span>socket.io</span> to emit events for the client
* Filters profanity using bad-words package

## How to Run It

* Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Brochin5671/statusfer.git
